# GuiCookie
[![N|Solid](https://github.com/LiruJ/GuiCookie/blob/master/GuiCookie/Icon.bmp)](https://www.lovebirb.com/)

An XML-based GUI framework for MonoGame 3.8 which is driven by reflection for custom elements and components, making it flexible enough for any game.

# About
GuiCookie is a simple yet powerful UI framework for MonoGame 3.8.

It loads styles and layouts from XML files, using reflection to link XML nodes to classes, allowing you to define custom behaviour for UI elements.

An entity-component system (ECS) has been used with an additional controller, allowing modular components that can be reused across many elements.

A style system completely removes the need for you to set graphics in code, instead referencing files in the style sheet and focusing on the design of the UI itself.

# Installation
The latest release can be downloaded via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lovebirb.MonoGame.GuiCookie).

# Wiki
All documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/LiruJ/GuiCookie/wiki), and the [Lovebirb Discord server](https://discord.gg/j8Dja6tfvM) can be joined for any specific help. The wiki is still a work in progress, but the example project of this repo should make things a bit more clear.
